## 🧐 About The Project

This repository serves as a centralized archive for my academic progression. It documents everything I have learned and implemented during my undergraduate studies. 

The primary goal of this repository is to:
* **Track Progress:** Maintain a record of my growth as a developer and student.
* **Archive Knowledge:** Store notes, past papers, and code snippets for future reference.
* **Open Source Learning:** Provide educational resources for other students who might find these materials useful.

> **Note:** This repository is maintained solely by me and is intended for educational purposes only.
